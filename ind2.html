    Blockchain brings transparency and traceability to supply chains. By recording every transaction on an immutable ledger,
    stakeholders can track the journey of products from manufacturing to delivery, reducing fraud, ensuring quality, and
    enhancing accountability.
    
    c. Healthcare:
    In the healthcare industry, blockchain ensures the secure and interoperable sharing of patient data. Patients have more
    control over their health information, and healthcare providers can access accurate and up-to-date records, leading to
    better patient care.
    
    d. Digital Identity Verification:
    Blockchain is transforming identity verification by providing a decentralized and secure way to manage digital
    identities. This has applications in areas such as online authentication, passport control, and access to secure
    facilities, reducing the risk of identity theft.
    
    Conclusion:
    Blockchain's decentralized and secure nature is disrupting traditional industries, offering transparency, security, and
    efficiency. As the technology continues to mature, its applications will likely expand, fundamentally transforming the
    way various sectors operate. The revolution fueled by blockchain is not just about financial transactions; it's about
    reimagining the foundations of trust and accountability in our interconnected world.</pre>
